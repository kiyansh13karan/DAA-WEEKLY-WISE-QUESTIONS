## About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions to the weekly programming assignments for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. Each week's folder contains the problem statements and my implementations in C++.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the specific week folder containing the problem you're interested in
2. Each file is named according to its problem statement (e.g., `linear_search_Q1.cpp`)
3. The code includes comments explaining the algorithm and implementation

## Key Features
- Organized by weeks for easy navigation
- Clean, commented code with proper documentation
- Covers fundamental algorithms including:
  - Searching and sorting algorithms
  - Graph algorithms
  - Dynamic programming
  - Greedy algorithms
  - Backtracking
  - And many more DAA concepts
